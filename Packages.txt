Functionalities
*Search - We want to allow the user to search for any book based on their title or their author.
The search feature will display the link, image, book and title of any book the user has
searched for. We would accomplish this by utilizing the event handling that we learned. We
will do this by giving the user an input field and letting them submit via a button.

*Rankings - We will offer the user the ability to view book rankings to see the top trending
books. This will be done by using state lifting in order to pass it to the child component, then
we would map through the list of ranks.
*Rank by rankings (original may be top rated already)

Book List - The user will be able to save a book they like and it will display itself in a list. The
user may also have the option to remove any book they no longer wish to keep on the list.
This will require us to use event handling to allow the user to change which books they
would like to add to their list. The list itself will be stored in a separate state variable as well.

*Sorting/Filter - For this feature we want to let the user modify their book list in a few different
ways. For example you could sort alphabetically or according to each book's respective
ranking. We would also implement composition to help style the list.

Purchase - For this feature we want to give the user the option to buy the book of their
choice. To do this we plan on implementing this feature by giving the user a link to the
appropriate website of the chosen book. In the API we are using every book has a few links
on where you can buy each book, and so we plan on incorporating this into our website
using this data.
